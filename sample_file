As long as Skyline decided to give the perpetrators some extra time before the investigation starts,  we figure we might as well lend a hand too.  Our oldcode was 880099.  We loved that code and are very upset at losing it.Our new eight digit one is very difficult to remember and nowhere near as fun.And one last note about those new eight digit numbers.Phone phreaks have ALREADY figured out a way around them.If you dial the first six digits of an eight digit code, then the ten digit phone number and hit a # key, you'll get your tone back!  That means there are only a hundred possible codes since there are only two more digits to figure out  and one of them DEFINITELY works!  If you enter six digits that are not part of an eight digit code, and then a ten digit phone number, you'll get an error message immediately or that fake carrier tone Skyline loves to send out.That tone, incidentally, is for you hackers with Apples and Commodores that scan all night long looking for the code that will get you through to a number that responds with a carrier tone. In the morning, you see how many carrier detects you got and which codes gotthem for you.  Skyline's idea is that if EVERY invalid code gives a hacker a carrier tone, there is no way for a computer to separate the good codes from the bad ones.Come on!  How about setting your computer to dial a NON-carrier and telling it to print out only those codes that DIDN'T get a carrier tone?And there are probably a hundred more ways.  Big corporations can be SO much fun.
